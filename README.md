These files are standalone html files, with all thumbnails embedded, so they're perfect for downloading for offline use.

# Generating your own:

You can use `fam.py` to generate a standalone html file from your own .crf or fam/ subdirectory.

You will need [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later, with [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/):

1. Download and install Python 3.6
2. Run cmd.exe (you will probably need to do this as administrator)
3. Run `pip install pillow`
4. Run `python fam.py` with the path to your .crf or fam/ subdirectory, and the name of the html file to generate.
